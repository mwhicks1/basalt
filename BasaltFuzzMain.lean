# `basalt-fuzz` executable entry point

Lean owns `main`: `PBT.dispatch` selects a named property and a backend and runs the campaign. This
module and everything it imports must stay Mathlib-free, since the executable links whatever it
imports; it is built by `fuzz-run/build.sh`, never by the default `lake build`.

open Basalt.Fuzz Basalt.PBT RandomChoice

/-- Infrastructure self-test: a deliberately false property. Its failure lives on a distinct branch
(`fail` vs `pass`), so it is reachable by coverage-guided search — libFuzzer hits a byte `≥ 200`
quickly, the counterexample is reported, and the process crashes for libFuzzer to record. -/
def propThreshold [Gen G] : PropM G Unit :=
  forAll (chooseNat 0 255) (· < 200)

/-- The property registry, selected by the first non-flag CLI argument. `bst-*` are the worked BST
demo (`BasaltFuzz/BuggyBST.lean`): the `-buggy-*` ones have real bugs every backend can find,
and the others must never fail. `chain-*` and `long-*` are the staged microbenchmarks
(`BasaltFuzz/Staged.lean`), the one place the backends differ by orders of magnitude;
`long-*` is the one whose difficulty is buffer length, so it is where `--grow` is measured.
`cedar-*` are the CedarLite experiment (`BasaltFuzz/Cedar.lean`, `CEDAR_EXPERIMENT.md`).

Each entry is a `Property`, so one registry serves every backend; `fun _ =>` is the explicit `G`
binder it asks for. -/

/-- `dispatch`'s default backend is the first one registered, which is `io` — Basalt's own backends
are registered by the import. This executable is a fuzzer, so it moves `fuzzBackend` to the front
rather than listing the backends: anything else tagged `@[basalt_backend]` is still offered. -/
