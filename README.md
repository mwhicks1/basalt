# Basalt

Basalt is a foundational representation of random data generators for property-based testing (PBT),
together with machine-checked proofs about them, in Lean 4. A single generator term is given a
precise semantics you can both run and reason about, so a generator can be proved sound, complete,
almost-surely terminating, and cost-bounded.

## Generator Representation

A generator is a term polymorphic in its monad, not a value of a fixed generator type:

```lean
def myGen [Gen G] : G α := ...
```

`Gen` bundles the operations a generator needs (`Monad`, `RandomChoice`, `CCPO`, `MonoBind`,
`Inhabited`). The *same* term is then interpreted at whichever monad the task calls for:

| Interpretation | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `Plausible.Gen` / `IO` | run it and get values |
| `WordModel σ` / `IOModel` | `IO`'s draws with the PRNG state threaded purely — what `IsFaithful` (below) relates `IO` and `SPMF` through |
| `SPMF` | a sub-probability mass function — reason about the distribution and its `support` |
| `SPMF.Cost` | the same, plus a count of random choices |
| `GenStats.StatGen` | seeded, fuel-guarded execution that counts choices (drives `#genstats`) |
| `Fuzz.FuzzGen` | choices read from a byte buffer, so a coverage-guided fuzzer drives generation |

`RandomChoice.choose` is the only source of randomness; every combinator (`elements`, `oneOf`,
`frequency`, `listOf`, …) is built on it. Recursive generators are defined by
`partial_fixpoint` over the `CCPO`. A choice between literal branches is written `oneOf! [g₀, g₁, …]`
or `frequency! [(w₀, g₀), …]`: it runs as a chain of tests on the drawn index, allocating no list of
branches, while every proof sees the plain `oneOf` / `frequency` (`Basalt/Combinators.lean`).

A generator that branches on a size adds a `[Sized G]` constraint and reads it with `getSize` or
`Sized.sized`, shrinking it for recursive calls with `Sized.resize` (plus `[MonoSized G]` when the
generator is a `partial_fixpoint`). `WithSize G` supplies the size to any interpretation `G`: run
the generator at `WithSize G` and close it with `.run n`. See `Basalt/Sized.lean`.

## Correctness Properties

`Basalt/Laws.lean` states the properties a generator may have as plain predicates; which apply
depends on the generator, and you prove the ones that do:

- `IsSoundAndComplete g P` — the support of `g` is exactly `P` (nothing invalid, nothing missed).
  Its halves are laws of their own: `IsSoundFor g P` (nothing invalid) and `IsCompleteFor g P`
  (nothing missed), for a generator that has only one.
- `IsAlmostSurelyTerminating g` — `g` terminates with probability 1.
- `IsCostBounded g c` — producing `v` takes at most `c v` random choices.
- `IsExpectedCostBounded g B` — producing a value takes at most `B` random choices on average, so a
  generator that sometimes retries is allowed. With `IsAlmostSurelyTerminating` and a finite `B`,
  it says that `g` terminates positively almost surely.

Each but the bundle `IsSoundAndComplete`, which a proof splits into its halves, is defined in the
form a reader checks, and restated by `<Law>.iff_obs` on the observation a proof walks:
`IsSoundFor g P ↔ SPMF.alwaysObs.spec g P`. A proof rewrites its goal with `iff_obs` and runs
`walk`, and passes a callee's law to it as `h.obs`.

Two more relate two interpretations rather than constraining one, so they take the polymorphic
generator:

- `IsFaithful gen` (`Basalt/IO/Laws.lean`) — on any ideal source of words, `gen` has its `SPMF`
  distribution, and at `IO` it runs as `IOModel` does wherever that terminates. This connects the
  proofs about `SPMF` to what `IO` runs; what it leaves out is `idealized_faithful`'s
  (`Basalt/IO/Faithful.lean`).
- `IsCostFaithful gen` — `gen` at `SPMF.Cost`, its costs dropped, has its `SPMF` distribution, so
  a law at one interpretation can be read at the other: termination gives the cost interpretation
  mass `1`, which a lower bound on an expected cost needs.

`BasaltExamples/` is a cookbook of worked generators, each carrying proofs of the properties that
apply to it. `WORKFLOW.md` walks through writing a generator and proving it correct, with a recipe
for each obligation, and one for bounding an expected value (`SPMF.expect`, such as the expected
size of what is generated).

## Running Properties

Generators are the inputs of property-based tests; `Basalt/PBT/` is the other half. A property lives
in `PropM G`, a generator monad that can *reject* the input it drew, so it is polymorphic in its
monad too. Its inputs are drawn with `generate` in an ordinary monadic `do` — several of them, or
dependent ones, need no special combinator:

```lean
def prop_takeDrop [Gen G] : PropM G Unit := do
  let xs ← generate (listOf (chooseNat 0 99))
  let k ← generate (chooseNat 0 99)
  assume !xs.isEmpty                              -- a precondition; discards this input
  check (xs.take k ++ xs.drop k == xs) s!"xs={xs}, k={k}"
```

Rejecting short-circuits, so `assume` is a statement rather than a nesting, and it holds through a
*function call* — a helper the property calls can reject the input on its behalf. `forAll gen p` is
the alternative to `generate`: it names the drawn value in the counterexample, and nests, with `p`
returning a property, a `Bool`, or a decidable `Prop`.

A campaign runs a property at a chosen interpretation, stopping at the first counterexample:

```lean
#eval ioCampaign (fun _ => prop_takeDrop) 1000
```

Because the property never named an interpretation, the same term is testable at each of them: a
`Property` is the property held polymorphically, and `dispatch` wraps a list of named properties in a
command line (`--backend=io|plausible`, `-runs=N`, `-discard_ratio=N`) over every `Backend` tagged
`@[basalt_backend]`, so an interpretation defined outside Basalt is offered there too. Every backend
shares one failure contract — counterexample on stderr, exit `77` — so campaigns are comparable
across them.

## Build

Lean and Mathlib are pinned in `lean-toolchain` / `lakefile.toml` / `lake-manifest.json`.

```sh
lake build                # library + examples + tests
lake build Basalt         # library only
lake build BasaltExamples # the cookbook
lake build BasaltTest     # regression tests
```

### Coverage-guided fuzzing (opt-in)

`basalt-fuzz` drives generators from libFuzzer instead of a PRNG. It links native code, so building
the *executable* is deliberately outside `lake build` and has its own script — which needs no
arguments on the platforms `fuzz-run/README.md` lists, detecting the toolchain's fuzzing runtime and
driver entry point itself:

```sh
fuzz-run/build.sh                                   # build the executable
fuzz-run/basalt-fuzz <property> [libFuzzer args...]  # run a campaign
fuzz-run/basalt-fuzz replay <property> <file>        # reproduce a saved crash input
```

Where no libFuzzer runtime ships with the toolchain (macOS), the build vendors one from
compiler-rt source on first use. Per-machine toolchain overrides go in `fuzz-run/env.sh`
(see `fuzz-run/env.example.sh`). `fuzz-run/README.md` is the whole story: the design, the demo
properties, the failure model, and the supported platforms.

Because a property is polymorphic in its monad, the same executable also runs it under the random
interpretations — `--backend=io` or `--backend=plausible` instead of the default coverage-guided
`fuzz` — from one shared property registry. Which backend finds a bug faster is a property of the
bug: blind random sampling wins on shallow bugs (fewer runs, ~2–5× the throughput), while a bug
behind several nested guards is reachable only by coverage guidance. `fuzz-run/compare-backends.sh` measures it and
`fuzz-run/README.md` records the numbers.

## Repository layout

- `Basalt/` — the library, in four tiers:
  - *the representation*: `RandomChoice.lean`, `Gen.lean`, `Sized.lean`, `Combinators.lean`, and
    `Laws.lean`, the properties a generator may be proved to have;
  - *the interpretations*: `SPMF/` (the distribution semantics and its theory — support, mass,
    expectations, cost, almost-sure termination), `IO.lean` and `IO/` (with `IsFaithful`),
    `PlausibleGen.lean`, `OptionT.lean`, `GenStats/`, and the opt-in `Fuzz/`, with `Random.lean`
    holding the facts about core's `randNat` that the PRNG-backed ones share;
  - *the proof machinery*: `Obs/`, the layer every per-combinator lemma is derived from — a
    judgment about a generator (its support, an expectation, a cost bound) is an *observation*, a
    `choose`-preserving monad morphism into a specification monad, and each combinator has one lemma
    saying that every observation commutes with it — `Walk/`, the judgment-agnostic walk over
    observations that every proof obligation is discharged by, its `walk` tactic, and one file per
    judgment of what the walk knows about it, and `GenRel.lean`, each combinator related to itself
    at two monads, for the judgments that relate interpretations;
  - *what a proof calls*: `walk`, and `Tactic/`, the tactics that do more than walk
    (`mass_fixpoint`, `faithful_fixpoint`) plus the support and `ℝ≥0∞` helpers; and `PBT/` and
    `Tuning/`, the front ends above.

  `Basalt.lean` is the only module that imports the library wholesale; every other module, inside
  the library and out, imports the narrowest thing it needs.
- `BasaltExamples/` — worked generators with correctness proofs. Because each file proves its
  generator's laws, this directory is also most of the effective regression suite for the library's
  lemma sets and tactics.
- `BasaltTest/` — regression tests, named for the library module they guard when one exists.
- `BasaltFuzz/` — the generators, properties, and buggy operations the `basalt-fuzz` executable
  fuzzes. Unlike the rest of the repo it is linked into a native executable, so it must stay
  Mathlib-free; `fuzz-run/README.md` says why and records what is instrumented for coverage.
- `BasaltFuzz/Cedar/`, `BasaltExamples/Cedar/` — generators for the real Cedar policy language's typing
  judgment and their proofs, and a coverage experiment; `CEDAR.md` is the whole story.
- `BasaltFuzzMain.lean` — the root of the opt-in `basalt-fuzz` executable: the property registry.
  Not a default build target, since only `fuzz-run/build.sh` links it.
- `fuzz-run/` — the `basalt-fuzz` build script, its backend benchmark, and `README.md`, which owns
  the fuzzing design and the per-platform build contract.
