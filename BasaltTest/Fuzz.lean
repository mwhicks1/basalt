# `FuzzGen` regression tests

Deterministic checks of the byte → choice mapping, run purely (no fuzzer): `runOne` on fixed byte
arrays must produce fixed outcomes. Pins the contract that a corpus byte maps to a specific choice.

/-! ### The cursor and the deficit

How many bytes a run read is what `--truncate` cuts an input to before mutating it, and how many of
those it was not given is the run's deficit. These pin the facts truncation rests on: both counts are
exact, and cutting an input to its cursor does not change its outcome. -/

private def renderRead (r : FuzzResult) : String :=
  s!"{render r} (read {r.cursor}, short {r.deficit})"

/- One byte for two draws: the second reads past the end and gets `0`, so the property fails on
`7 < 0`, having read two bytes and gone without one. -/
/-- info: fail: x=7, y=0 (read 2, short 1) -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderRead (runOne propTwo (bytes [7])))

/- A run that fits inside its buffer reads only what it draws: the tail is dead. -/
/-- info: fail: x=7, y=3 (read 2, short 0) -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderRead (runOne propTwo (bytes [7, 3, 9, 9, 9])))

/- Cut to its cursor, the same input runs the same: what `--truncate` does before a mutation. -/
/-- info: fail: x=7, y=3 (read 2, short 0) -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderRead (runOne propTwo (bytes [7, 3])))

/- The deficit counts every byte the run went without, not just the first: after `[1, 5]` builds a
node, `genBST` recurses on both subtrees and each reads a `frequency` byte past the end. -/
/-- info: pass (read 4, short 2) -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderRead (runOne propBSTsizeNonneg (bytes [1, 5])))

/-! ### One property, every backend

`basalt-fuzz --backend=` rests on one registry entry (a `Basalt.PBT.Property`) running at `FuzzGen`,
`IO`, and `Plausible.Gen`. These pin that, so a monomorphic property or a missing `Gen` instance is a
build failure here rather than a link error in the opt-in executable. -/

private def propAnyBackend : Property := fun _ => do
  let x ← generate (chooseNat 0 9)
  check (x ≤ 9) s!"x={x}"

/- `x ≤ 9` holds for every draw, so the outcome is `pass` whatever the backend chooses. -/
/-- info: pass -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (render (runOne (propAnyBackend FuzzGen) (bytes [4])))

/-- info: pass -/
#guard_msgs in #eval do IO.println (renderOutcome (← runProp (propAnyBackend IO)))

/-- info: pass -/
#guard_msgs in
#eval do IO.println (renderOutcome (← Plausible.Gen.run (runProp (propAnyBackend Plausible.Gen)) 0))

/-! ### The fuzz target's `genBST` is the proved one

`BasaltFuzz/BuggyBST.lean` restates `BasaltExamples/BST`'s `Tree.genBST` rather than importing it, because
that import would pull Mathlib into the executable's link closure (`fuzz-run/README.md`). The copy's
claim — that the fuzzed generator is the one proved sound, complete, terminating, and cost-bounded —
holds only while the two agree, so these pins make a drift a build failure: both are
`[Gen G]` terms, so at `FuzzGen` on the same bytes they must build the same tree. -/

/- A compact `(left key right)` s-expression rather than `Repr`, so a pin is one line. It preserves
structure, unlike `toList`, which is not injective on trees and would pass two differently-shaped
trees with the same keys. -/
private def showOrig : BST.Tree Int → String
  | .leaf => "."
  | .node l x r => s!"({showOrig l} {x} {showOrig r})"

private def showCopy : BuggyBST.Tree → String
  | .leaf => "."
  | .node l x r => s!"({showCopy l} {x} {showCopy r})"

/- Runs both generators on one buffer, printing the shared tree so a mismatch shows what each
produced rather than just `false`. -/
private def agreeOn (bs : List UInt8) : String :=
  let lo := BuggyBST.loKey
  let hi := BuggyBST.hiKey
  let orig : FuzzGen String := showOrig <$> BST.Tree.genBST lo hi
  let copy : FuzzGen String := showCopy <$> BuggyBST.genBST lo hi
  let run (g : FuzzGen String) : Option String := (g.run ⟨⟨bs.toArray⟩, 0⟩).map (·.1)

  | some a, some b => if a == b then s!"agree: {a}" else s!"DIFFER: example={a} fuzz={b}"
