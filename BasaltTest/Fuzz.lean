# `FuzzGen` regression tests

Deterministic checks of the byte → choice mapping, run purely (no fuzzer): `runOne` on fixed byte
arrays must produce fixed outcomes. Pins the contract that a corpus byte maps to a specific choice.

/-! ### The deficit

How many bytes a run wanted beyond the ones it was given is the whole feedback channel for `--grow`,
which appends that many zeros. These pin the two facts growth rests on: the count is exact, and
appending zeros does not change the outcome. -/

private def renderShort (r : FuzzResult) : String := s!"{render r} (short {r.deficit})"

/- One byte for two draws: the second reads past the end and gets `0`, so the property fails on
`7 < 0` and reports a deficit of exactly the one byte it went without. -/
/-- info: fail: x=7, y=0 (short 1) -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderShort (runOne propTwo (bytes [7])))

/- Materializing that byte is what `--grow` does, and it is semantics-preserving: the same failure,
now with the byte the fuzzer can mutate actually present in the input. -/

#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderShort (runOne propTwo (bytes [7, 0])))

/- A run that fits inside its buffer reports no deficit, which is what keeps growth from firing on
inputs that were never starved. -/

#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderShort (runOne propTwo (bytes [3, 7])))

/- The deficit counts every byte the run went without, not just the first: after `[1, 5]` builds a
node, `genBST` recurses on both subtrees and each reads a `frequency` byte past the end. -/
/-- info: pass (short 2) -/
#guard_msgs in #eval IO.println (renderShort (runOne propBSTsizeNonneg (bytes [1, 5])))

/-! ### Random fill

Under `randomFill` a read past the end is a byte of the buffer's own seeded stream, so a run is
still a function of its buffer, reads inside the buffer are unchanged, and materializing the bytes
a run read past its end (what `--grow` does) preserves it. The bridge computes the same stream from
the seed, so it pins the same `mix64 1`. -/

/-! ### One property, every backend

`basalt-fuzz --backend=` rests on one registry entry (a `Basalt.PBT.Property`) running at `FuzzGen`,
`IO`, and `Plausible.Gen`. These pin that, so a monomorphic property or a missing `Gen` instance is a
build failure here rather than a link error in the opt-in executable. -/

private def propAnyBackend : Property := fun _ => do
  let x ← generate (chooseNat 0 9)
  check (x ≤ 9) s!"x={x}"

/-! ### The fuzz target's `genBST` is the proved one

`Fuzz/BuggyBST.lean` restates `BasaltExamples/BST`'s `Tree.genBST` rather than importing it, because
that import would pull Mathlib into the executable's link closure (`fuzz-run/README.md`). The copy's
claim — that the fuzzed generator is the one proved sound, complete, terminating, and cost-bounded —
holds only while the two agree, so these pins make a drift a build failure: both are
`[Gen G]` terms, so at `FuzzGen` on the same bytes they must build the same tree. -/

/- A compact `(left key right)` s-expression rather than `Repr`, so a pin is one line. It preserves
structure, unlike `toList`, which is not injective on trees and would pass two differently-shaped
trees with the same keys. -/

/-! ## `RecordGen` replays at `FuzzGen`

A run at `RecordGen` must decode, at `FuzzGen`, to the same outcome while reading exactly the bytes
it recorded: what a warm-up seed (`fuzz-run/README.md`) relies on. `readNat_recordDraw` proves it
per draw; this checks whole runs, over ranges that take one byte, several bytes, a range that is a
power of 256, and a bignum. -/
