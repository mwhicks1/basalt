# Compare settings of the fuzz backend by the share of campaigns that find the counterexample within a
# fixed run budget. Reproduces the tables in fuzz-run/README.md that compare settings.
#
# This is the intra-backend counterpart of compare-backends.sh. SETTINGS is the list of flag sets to
# compare, space-separated, the flags of one set joined by commas, `off` meaning no extra flag:
#
#   SETTINGS="off --truncate" fuzz-run/compare-settings.sh chain-2 chain-3 chain-4 long-16
#
# A success rate rather than a median of runs-to-failure: the distribution is heavy-tailed enough that
# repeated median passes over one binary disagree in sign, while a rate is a binomial, with error bar
# sqrt(p(1-p)/n), so two cells are comparable.
#
# Usage: fuzz-run/compare-settings.sh [property...]        (default: chain-2 chain-3 chain-4 long-16)
