# Build the opt-in `basalt-fuzz` executable. Lake owns the module closure, the SanitizerCoverage
# scope (the `BasaltFuzz` library and the executable root, per lakefile.toml), and the link; this
# script owns what Lake's declarative config cannot express — detecting this platform's libFuzzer
# runtime and C++ runtime, compiling the C bridge, and asserting the properties a wrong answer would
# otherwise degrade silently. Lean owns `main`, which calls Fuzz.go -> libFuzzer's driver. See
# fuzz-run/README.md.
#
# Portable across macOS (arm64) and Linux; everything platform-specific is detected below, and each
# detection can be overridden by the environment variable named in its block. `fuzz-run/env.sh`, if
# present, is sourced first — that is the place for per-machine overrides (it is git-ignored).

# The libFuzzer runtime to link. Preference order:
#   1. FUZZER_LIB_FLAGS from the environment / env.sh (an explicit choice wins).
#   2. A toolchain `libclang_rt.fuzzer_no_main*.a` whose clang major MATCHES the instrumenting clang.
#   3. fuzz-run/vendor/libFuzzerNoMain.a, built from compiler-rt source by ./get-libfuzzer.sh, pinned
#      to Lean's clang major — so it is version-matched too (macOS; and any Linux whose only system
#      runtime is a different clang, e.g. `ubuntu-latest`'s clang 16 vs Lean's clang 22).
#   4. Last resort: a version-*mismatched* system runtime, with a warning (see below).
# `fuzzer_no_main` (not `fuzzer`) is required: we provide LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput and call the driver
# ourselves from Lean's `main`.
#
# Why the major must match: the runtime implements the SanitizerCoverage ABI that the instrumenting
# clang emits calls against. That ABI is broadly stable, but a large skew can leave an
# instrumented-but-uninstrumented-feeling binary — it links and runs, and shallow bugs still fail,
# yet coverage never reaches the runtime (fuzz-run/README.md, "Platforms"). Matching the major closes
# that gap by construction rather than by trusting cross-version stability.

#   - A bare `-lstdc++` is silently dropped: leanc's vendored clang already appends `-lc++`, so lld

#     A `.so` given by path is an unconditional input and always contributes its symbols.
#   - The runtime is built by a recent clang against a recent libstdc++, so an older one leaves
#     undefined symbols (gcc 11's lacks `std::__glibcxx_assert_fail`, added in gcc 12). Newer
#     libstdc++ is ABI-forward-compatible, so the newest installed is always the safe choice — the
